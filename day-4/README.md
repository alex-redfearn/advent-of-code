# Day 4: Ceres Search

Searching a crossword. Enjoyed this one! The first time I've actually written an alogrithm to do this.

## Part 1

Find all occurrences of a word in a grid. This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words.

## Part 2

Find instances of a word e.g. MAS in the shape of an X. Within the X, each MAS can be written forwards or backwards.
