Do you like dags?

Good tip from a collegue suggested that this problem is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

## Part 1

Identify all the nodes that are already sorted, based on the DAG, and sum their middle nodes.

## Part 2

Identify all the node lists that are unsorted, sort them, and sum their middle numbers.
